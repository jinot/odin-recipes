    <h2>Description</h2>

   <!--Hou to do-->
    <h2>Steps</h2>

     <ol>
        <li>In a large pan or wok, add in the diced pork and cook for about 10 mins, until the liquid in the pan has almost evaporated.</li>
         <br>
        <li>Add in dried shrimps, rock sugar, star anise, five spice powder and stir fry for 30 secs. Do not worry if the rock sugar is still hard as it will melt eventually.</li>
         <br>
        <li>Add in the sauces, shallot, garlic and ½ of the rice wine and stir for another minute.</li>
         <br>
        <li>Cover and bring simmer for 5 mins. The sauce should be bubbling and slightly thick.</li>
         <br>
        <li>Add in hot water just enough cover the pork (we want a gravy consistency and not a soup) and place in hard boil eggs (if using) and simmer for 30 mins.</li>
         <br>
        <li>Turn the eggs occasionally so both sides are evenly stewed.</li>
         <br>
        <li>After 30 mins, add in the remaining rice wine and cover for another 2 mins</li>
         <br>
        <li>Serve warm.</li>
     </ol>
